                <span>Invention of the game</span>
                The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in
                Springfield,
                Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months.

                <span>The first basketball game</span>
                The first basketball court: Springfield College
                On December 21, 1891, Naismith published rules for a new game using five basic ideas and thirteen rules.
                That day, he
                asked his class to play a match in the Armory Street court: 9 versus 9, using a soccer ball and two
                peach baskets. Frank
                Mahan, one of his students, wasn't so happy. He just said: "Harrumph. Another new game".Someone proposed
                to call it
                "Naismith Game", but he suggested "We have a ball and a basket: why don’t we call it basketball?"

                <span>First international games</span>
                After its arrival in Europe, basketball developed very quickly. In 1909 the first international match
                was held in Saint
                Petersburg: Mayak Saint Petersburg beat a YMCA American team

                <span>Formation of FIBA</span>
                World basketball was growing, but it was on June 18, 1932 that a real international organization was
                formed, to
                coordinate tournaments and teams: that day, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal,
                Romania and
                Switzerland founded the International Basketball Federation (Fédération internationale de basketball
                amateur, FIBA) in
                Geneva

                <span>NBA</span>
                The Basketball Association of America (BAA) was founded on June 6, 1946, in New York City.The league
                adopted the
                name National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949 after merging with the rival National Basketball
                League (NBL). As of
                the early 21st century, the NBA is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in
                terms of
                popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
